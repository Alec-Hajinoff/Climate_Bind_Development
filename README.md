Climate Bind is a web application that enables digital parametric weather insurance using smart contracts and digital currency. Coverage is triggered automatically by predefined weather events - such as extreme rainfall or drought - based on verified third-party data. When conditions are met, payouts are issued directly to the user's digital wallet with no claims process.

The platform is offered as a white-label solution for insurers and institutions. Partners can configure trigger conditions, payout rules, and coverage terms, while retaining full control over branding and customer relationships. The system handles event monitoring, contract execution, and digital currency transactions end-to-end.A
