        Climate Bind is a web application that enables digital parametric
        weather insurance using smart contracts and digital currency. Coverage
        is triggered automatically by predefined weather events - such as
        extreme rainfall or drought - based on verified third-party data. When
        conditions are met, payouts are issued directly to the user's digital
        wallet with no claims process.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform is offered as a white-label solution for insurers and
        institutions. Partners can configure trigger conditions, payout rules,
        and coverage terms, while retaining full control over branding and
        customer relationships. The system handles event monitoring, contract
        execution, and digital currency transactions end-to-end.
