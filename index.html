                    Peer-to-peer insurance is where policyholders insure each other without an insurance company between
                    them. This insurance model has its pluses and minuses, and our platform aims to maximise the
                    benefits while reducing the disadvantages.
                    <br><br>
                    This type of insurance may better suit policyholders who cannot insure their property
                    through traditional insurance, or where such insurance is expensive.
                    <br><br>
                    Our insurance service is free to use because we don't actually accept insurance
                    premiums, and we don't pay them out. We merely act as a matching engine between those claiming and
                    those insuring.
                    <br><br>
                    If two different policyholders insure each other, they each make a legally binding commitment to
                    insure one another (up to the amount they themselves set). The higher the amount a policyholder can
                    pay out to another, the higher the amount they can themselves claim.
                    <br><br>
                    We are currently in development, and we would love to hear from you if you are interested in
                    insuring your home, if you are a web developer interested in working with us, or if you would like
                    to financially sponsor the project.
